## Codebook for Reshaped Travel Data

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains travel data from various regions and countries, spanning from the year 2002 to 2024. The data captures the number of travelers to different destinations across multiple years. The dataset is useful for analyzing travel trends, the impact of global events on travel, and comparing the popularity of different destinations over time.

### Variable Names, Classes, and Meanings

| Variable Name           | Class   | Meaning                                                                                  | Example                                      |
  |-------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
  | 首站抵達地 | Factor  | The primary destination where travelers arrive.                                           | 亞洲地區 (Asia Region)                        |
  | 細分 | Factor  | A more specific destination within the primary destination.                              | 日本Japan (Japan), 韓國Korea (Korea)           |
  | Year                    | Integer | The year during which the travel data was recorded.                                      | 2002, 2024                                   |
  | Number_of_Travelers     | Numerics | The total number of travelers to the specified destination in the given year.             | 1309847 (for Japan in 2008), NA (missing data) |

### Brief Description of Variables

- **首站抵達地 (First Destination)**: This variable indicates the primary region where travelers arrive. It includes broader geographic areas such as Asia, Africa, America, Oceania, and Europe.

- **細分 (Subdivision)**: This variable provides a more specific destination within the primary region. It includes countries and regions such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China, Macao, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, UAE, Turkey, and other regions.

- **Year**: This variable represents the year in which the travel data was recorded, ranging from 2002 to 2024.

- **Number_of_Travelers**: This variable indicates the total number of travelers to the specific destination in the given year. The values can be numeric or "NA" if the data is not available for that year.

### Notes
- The dataset includes missing values represented by "NA".
- The data covers multiple regions and countries, making it suitable for comprehensive travel trend analysis.

# i have a dataframe attatched. Parse its varibles into right classes according to Codebook and using R program follow tidyverse style, and the R for data science book (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) closely. 

To parse the variables of your dataframe according to the codebook and follow the tidyverse style as described in "R for Data Science", you can use the following R code:

```r
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the CSV file
travel_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddieHsu96/113-2-Demo/main/reshaped_travel_data.csv")

# Parse the variables according to the codebook
parsed_travel_data <- travel_data %>%
  mutate(
    `首站抵達地 (First Destination)` = as.factor(`首站抵達地 (First Destination)`),
    `細分 (Subdivision)` = as.factor(`細分 (Subdivision)`),
    Year = as.integer(Year),
    Number_of_Travelers = as.integer(Number_of_Travelers)
  )

# Display the parsed dataframe
print(parsed_travel_data)
```

This code does the following:
1. Loads the necessary libraries (`tidyverse` package).
2. Reads the CSV file from the provided URL.
3. Parses the variables according to the codebook:
   - Converts `首站抵達地 (First Destination)` and `細分 (Subdivision)` to factors.
   - Converts `Year` to an integer.
   - Converts `Number_of_Travelers` to an integer.
4. Prints the parsed dataframe.

Make sure to have the `tidyverse` package installed by running `install.packages("tidyverse")` if you haven't already.

You can modify the file path to the local path if you have the CSV file saved locally.

### code:

#library(tidyverse)

# 讀取資料
data <- read_csv("/cloud/project/reshaped_travel_data.csv") |>
  mutate(
    `首站抵達地` = as.factor(`首站抵達地`),
    細分 = as.factor(細分),
    Year = as.integer(Year),
    Number_of_Travelers = as.numerics(Number_of_Travelers)
  )

# 查看結果
glimpse(data)

# Display the parsed dataframe
print(parsed_travel_data)



# please summarise each variables properly according to their classes.
